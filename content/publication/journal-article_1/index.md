abstract: We speak to express ourselves. Sometimes words can capture what we mean; sometimes we mean more than can be said. This is where our visible gestures - those dynamic oscillations of our gaze, face, head, hand, arms and bodies – help. Not only do these co-verbal visual signals help express our intentions, attitudes and emotion, they also help us engage with our conversational partners to get our message across.
