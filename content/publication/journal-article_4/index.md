abstract: People commonly move along with auditory rhythms in the environment. Although the processes underlying such sensorimotor synchronisation have been extensively investigated in the previous research, the properties of auditory rhythms that facilitate the synchronisation remain largely unclear. This study explored the possible benefits of a continuity matching between auditory pacers and the movement produced as well as of a spatial pattern matching that has been previously demonstrated with visual pacers. Participants synchronised either finger tapping or forearm oscillations with either discrete or continuous pacers. The pacers had either a spatial pattern (left–right panning) that matched the movement pattern produced or no spatial pattern. The accuracy and variability of synchronisation were assessed by the mean and standard deviation of the asynchronies, respectively, between participant’s movement and the pacers. Results indicated that synchronisation was more accurate and less variable for discrete pacers and continuous movement (i.e., forearm oscillations). The interaction between those two factors involved a more complex relationship than a simple continuity match benefit. Although synchronisation variability increased with continuous pacers for both types of movement, this increase was smaller for continuous movement than discrete movement, suggesting that continuous movement is more beneficial only for continuous pacers. Moreover, the results revealed limited benefits of spatial pattern matching on auditory-motor synchronisation variability, which might be due to lower spatial resolution of the auditory sensory modality. Together, these findings confirm that sensorimotor synchronisation is modulated by complex relations between pacer and movement properties.
