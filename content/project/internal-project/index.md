Expressive speech: My research on expressive speech (ARC grants 2012-4; 2013-5) has employed innovative methods (e.g., “Disgust expressive speech: The acoustic consequences of the facial expression of emotion" - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2017.12.007 Speech Communication 2018; “Recognizing prosody across modalities, face areas and speakers: Examining perceivers’ sensitivity to variable realizations of visual prosody” - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2011.11.013 Cognition 2012 ) and developed a unique motion capture dataset (“Tracking eyebrows and head gestures associated with spoken prosody” - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2013.06.003 Speech Communication 2014).
