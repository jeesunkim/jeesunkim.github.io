Reading Research: My research on reading has reveaded how reading is influenced by both orthographic and phonological processing. For example, in "Orthographic–phonological links in the lexicon: When lexical and sublexical information conflict" - https://doi.org/10.1023/B:READ.0000013805.77364.cd I examined the level at which orthographic and phonological representations are linked. This work was extended by "Using Korean to investigate phonological priming effects without the influence of orthography" - https://doi.org/10.1080/01690960143000281 - with follow-up work making more use of two writing systems, e.g., in “Task effects in masked cross-script translation and phonological priming”, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0749-596X(03)00093-7- Journal of Memory and Language, 2003. Research conducted on my National Academy of Education (NAE) Spencer Fellowship probed developmental reading disorders (e.g., “Characteristics of poor readers of Korean Hangul: Auditory, visual and phonological processing” - https://doi.org/10.1023/B:READ.0000013804.76677.a9  Reading and Writing, 2004. Leveraging cross-language comparisons, I sort to determine the role of script in picking out processing weaknesses (“The effect of script on poor readers' sensitivity to dynamic visual stimuli” - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2004.05.001  Brain and Language 2004; and have examined the staus of phones and tones “Are tones phones?” - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2010.07.008  Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 2011.
